I am a PhD researcher in computational chemistry at Cardiff University, where I integrate advanced AI algorithms with quantum mechanical modelling to develop cost-effective and transferable workflows for materials modelling. I am part of the interdisciplinary Prosperity Partnership Sustainable Catalysis for Clean Growth, working with partners in industry (Johnson Matthey and bp, through the bp-ICAM) and academia (University of Manchester) to advance the fundamental understanding of complex catalytic materials for clean and sustainable energy.
