I am an interdisciplinary researcher at the <strong>"intersection of machine learning and electronic structure theory"</strong> to construct accurate predictive models of complex catalytic materials. I am passionate about accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future through advances in computational modelling, guided by fundamental scientific research, with the power to transform society.

I have recently completed my <strong>"PhD in computational chemistry"</strong> at the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, supervised by Dr Andrew Logsdail, in collaboration with Johnson Matthey and bp. I previously completed my <strong>"MSc in molecular modelling"</strong> at University College London, under the supervision of Sir Richard Catlow, and my <strong>"MEng in chemical engineering"</strong> at the University of Birmingham, under the supervision of Professor Gary Leeke.
