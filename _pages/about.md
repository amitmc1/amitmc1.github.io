I am an interdisciplinary researcher at the intersection of <strong>machine learning</strong> and <strong>electronic structure theory</strong>to construct accurate predictive models of complex catalytic materials. I am passionate about accelerating the transition to a sustainable energy future through advances in computational modelling, guided by fundamental scientific research, with the power to transform society.

<p></p>

I have recently completed my <strong>PhD in computational chemistry</strong> at the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, supervised by Dr Andrew Logsdail, in collaboration with Johnson Matthey and bp. I previously completed my <strong>MSc in molecular modelling</strong> at University College London under the supervision of Sir Richard Catlow, and my <strong>MEng in chemical engineering</strong> at the University of Birmingham under the supervision of Professor Gary Leeke.

## Research Interests and Experience
<ul>
  <li>Electronic structure modelling of defects and polarons in complex oxides, including DFT+<em>U</em> and hybrid-DFT.</li>

  <li>Accelerating materials modelling using deep learning, including exchange–correlation functionals and machine-learned interatomic potentials.</li>

  <li>Integrated workflows for scientific machine learning, incorporating symbolic regression, support vector machines, and Bayesian optimisation.</li>

  <li>Applied large language models for high-dimensional optimisation problems and generative molecular modelling.</li>

  <li>High-performance computing on CPU and GPU architectures; validating theoretical predictions and extracting insights from experimental characterisation (EPR, XANES, TEM, XPS).</li>
</ul>
