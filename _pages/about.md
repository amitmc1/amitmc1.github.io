I am a PhD researcher in computational chemistry at <a href="https://tamm-cci.github.io/" target="_blank">Cardiff University</a>, where I integrate advanced AI algorithms with quantum mechanical modelling to develop cost-effective and transferable workflows for materials modelling. I am part of the interdisciplinary Prosperity Partnership <a href="https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FV056565%2F1" target="_blank">Sustainable Catalysis for Clean Growth</a>, working with partners in industry (Johnson Matthey and <a href="https://www.icam-online.org/videos/achieving-net-zero-sustainable-catalysis-for-clean-growth/" target="_blank">bp, through the bp-ICAM</a>) and academia (University of Manchester) to advance the fundamental understanding of complex catalytic materials for clean and sustainable energy.
