I completed my PhD under the supervision of Dr Andrew Logsdail at the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, in collaboration with Johnson Matthey and the bp International Centre for Advanced Materials (bp-ICAM), as part of the EPSRC-funded Prosperity Partnership <em>Sustainable Catalysis for Clean Growth</em>.

My thesis is titled <strong>"Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Modelling Defect-Driven Catalytic Phenomena"</strong>, focusing on the development and application of machine learning-aided quantum mechanical simulations to understand how defects influence the performance of catalytic materials.

<br>

<ul>
  <li>Developing new machine-learning methods for determining DFT+<em>U</em> parameters that enable accurate and efficient simulations of polarons in transition metal and rare-earth oxides.</li>
  <li>Applying DFT-parameterised statistical algorithms and interatomic potentials to investigate design strategies for sulfur-tolerant industrial catalysts.</li>
</ul>
