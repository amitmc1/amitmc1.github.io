excerpt: "We investigate atomistic origin of the preferential formation of paramagnetic Nb<sup>4+</sup> and W<sup>5+</sup> species in Nb- and W-doped rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> <em>vs.</em> non-magnetic Nb<sup>5+</sup> and W<sup>6+</sup> species in doped anatase TiO<sub>2</sub>. This is achieved using a combination of theory (Hubbard corrected density functional theory) and experiment (powder electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy)."

## Abstract

Controlling the formation of electron polarons in TiO<sub>2</sub> doped with transition metals is important for the design of transparent conducting oxides for high-efficiency photovoltaics and photocatalysts with tuneable reaction selectivities. In this work, EPR spectroscopy is combined with Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+<em>U</em>), using refined atomic-like Hubbard projectors, to show the sensitivity of charge compensation in substitutionally doped Nb–TiO<sub>2</sub> and W–TiO<sub>2</sub> with respect to the TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorph (<em>i.e.</em>, anatase or rutile). Both EPR magnetic tensors and DFT+<em>U</em> predicted Nb 4<em>d</em> and W 5<em>d</em> orbital occupancies show the formation of differing dopant charge states depending on the TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorph, with non-magnetic Nb<sup>5+</sup> and W<sup>6+</sup> in doped anatase, and paramagnetic Nb<sup>4+</sup> and W<sup>5+</sup> in doped rutile. The results demonstrate how a coherent experiment-and-theory-validated framework can be used to understand and predict the reducibility of dopants and electron-trapping energetics in TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs. The outcome enables greater control over the electronic and magnetic properties of metal-oxide semiconductors, which is crucial for the rational design of next-generation materials for energy-conversion and catalytic applications.
